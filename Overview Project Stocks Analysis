# ** Project Overview **


##1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

#### Steve's parents want to invest in Green Energy Stocks, and they have chosen the DAQO Stock. 
The purpose of this project is to help Steve's parents analyse other Greens Stocks in addition
to DAQO Stock, so they can invest based on real data.


##2.1 Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 
2017 and 2018: 

#### The best way to analyse the Green Stocks is to combine both years, 2017 and 2018, to have
a better view of the return along time. The more data we have, the better. In this case we only
have data from two years. The graph below shows the average return for different Green Energy 
Stocks from years 2017 and 2018. ENPH shows the best return with 106%, following by SEDG with
88%. DQ comes in third place with 68% return.

##2.2 Results: The execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

#### The refactored script executes in a faster time. It does not have to execute different
Macros, this way it runs more effectivaly, and the script is cleaner.

##3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions:

    ###3.1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

    #### Advantages: Refactoring is improving desing, it is a way to optimize existing code 
    without changing its behavior. It also makes the script easier to understand or read,
    it is less complex and it is easier to maintain.

    #### Disadvantages: It is time consuming.

    ###3.2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

    #### I could say it was a bit easier because we had the starter code ready for us to
    fill in. Therefore we have all the pros that a refactoring can give us and was not 
    that bad in terms of time consuming.
